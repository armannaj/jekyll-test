How to move your blog from Wordpress to Github Pages?

I recently needed to have much more control over my blog, so I had two options. One was to upgrade to a much higher plan on wordpress Or have my blog with another CMS. I had heard a lot about Jekyll and how easy and fast it is for creating blogs and websites. In addition to that, Github hosts that for you For FREE, and we all know that github has a massive hosting infrastructure across the world, won't go down, It's extremely fast and realiable.&#x20;

So I decided to move my contents from Wordpress to a blog created by Jekyll. Little I know, it was harder than I thought. I've decided to write it down for others so that you won't go through all the troubles I did.
